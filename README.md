A feature-rich, high-performance arcade puzzle game inspired by the classic *Bouncing Balls / Bubble Shooter* genre. Built from scratch in **C++** using the **Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL2)** library as the final project for the **Fundamentals of Programming (Course 25768)** at **Sharif University of Technology** under the supervision of **Dr. Arasteh** and **Dr. Vosooghi Vahdat**.

  +-------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### 🎯 Core Mechanics
* **Precision Cannon & Raycasting:**
  * Real-time, zero-latency mouse-tracking cannon positioned at the bottom center of the screen.
  * Dotted aiming trajectory that calculates and visualizes wall bounce reflections.
  * Quick ball swapping using the `SPACE` key.
  * **Adaptive Color Generation Algorithm:** The cannon guarantees only colors currently present on the board are spawned (e.g., if only Red and Green remain, no other base colors are queued).
* **Match & Explosion Physics:**
  * Pop mechanics triggered only when a projectile connects to form a cluster of 3 or more contiguous balls of matching color.
  * Real-time connectivity check: Any unanchored ball or floating island whose path to the top ceiling is severed falls and is eliminated.
  * Smooth wall reflections for projectile trajectories.

## 🕹️ Game Modes

The project supports four distinct gameplay modes:

| Mode | Type | Description | Victory / End Condition |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **Normal / Classic** | Base | Features 5+ hand-crafted layout stages with gradual descending rows. | Clear all balls on the board. |
| **Timed Mode** | Base | Classic mechanics augmented with a countdown clock. | Clear the board before the timer expires. |
| **Random Mode** | Bonus | Procedural grid generator with smart neighbor-affinity algorithms ensuring playable color clusters. | Clear all randomly generated balls. |
| **Endless Mode** | Bonus | Continuous, infinite wave generation. | Ends when balls reach the cannon threshold (Score = total balls popped). |

## 🔮 Ball Types, Powers & Special Effects

### 🔴 Base & Obstacle Balls
* **Standard Balls (5+ Colors):** Core puzzle elements requiring 3-match clusters to pop.
* **Black Ball (Indestructible):** Cannot be popped through color matching; destroyed exclusively by severing ceiling anchor connections.
* **Dual-Color Ball (★ Bonus):** Contains two split colors, acting as a wildcard for either color cluster.
* **Locked Ball (★ Bonus):** Encased in an outer shell. A direct hit breaks its lock and recursively unlocks all contiguous locked neighbors.

### ⚡ Cannon Powers & Projectiles
* **Rainbow / Multicolor Ball:** Wildcard projectile that connects and pops any color cluster on contact.
* **Bomb / Explosive Ball (★ Bonus):** High-impact projectile that detonates an area-of-effect (AOE) radius on impact with dedicated explosion animations.
* **Laser Beam (★ Bonus):** Pierces across the entire trajectory line, destroying all balls in its straight-line path with special beam visual effects.
* **Power Bar UI (★ Bonus):** Dedicated on-screen inventory bar to hold, select, and equip special power-up balls on demand.

### ⏱️ Dynamic Time Effects (★ Bonus)
* **Pause Effect:** Freezes the descending grid temporarily; balls struck while paused are immediately destroyed.
* **Slow Motion Effect:** Significantly slows down grid descent speed for easier clears.

## 🎨 Menus, Audio & Visual Polish

* **Main & Start Menus:** User profile system, persistent username registration, and game mode selection.
* **Pause Menu (`ESC`):** In-game overlay supporting seamless resume, exit, and real-time audio adjustments.
* **Settings & Customization:**
  * **Audio Control:** Master volume slider, SFX toggles, and background music track switcher.
  * **Theme Switcher:** Customizable background textures and ball skins/color palettes.
* **Persistent Leaderboard:** File I/O system tracking high scores, usernames, and performance stats per game mode.
* **Animation Engine:**
  * Particle and burst animations for popping balls.
  * Gravity-simulated acceleration for disconnected floating balls.
  * Specialized explosion FX and laser beam renders.
